Software Requirements: Arduino Environment ARDUINO 1.6.1- It is the open source software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it in the micro- controller board. It runs on various platforms like Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The environment is written in Java and it is based on another open source software.
System Architecture components description:â€¨
Micro-controller Arduino UNO: The Uno is a micro-controller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analogue inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the micro-controller HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: This economical sensor provides 2cm to 400cm of non- contact measurement functionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach up to 3mm. Each HC-SR04 module includes an ultrasonic transmitter, a receiver and a control circuit. There are only four pins that you need to worry about on the HC-SR04: VCC (Power), Trig (Trigger), Echo (Receive), and GND (Ground).
