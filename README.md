# Arduino-Security-and-Alarm-System-Project
The alarm activates in ten seconds once pressing the A button. For police work objects it uses associate unhearable sensing element, and once the alarm detects one thing a buzzer starts emitting a sound. so as to prevent the alarm, we'd like to insert a four digits password. The planned password is 1234 however we have a tendency to even have the likelihood to vary it. By pressing the B button we have a tendency to enter the password change menu wherever first we'd like to enter this password so as to continue and so enter the new four digits password. Once the password is modified, following time we have a tendency to activate the alarm, we'll solely be able to stop the alarm by coming into the new password. If we have a tendency to enter a wrong password we'll get a message that we'd like to undertake once more.
